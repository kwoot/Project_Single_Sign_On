    # This program will set up the IPA Server.
    # Version 4.9.6
    # 
    # This includes:
    #   * Configure a stand-alone CA (dogtag) for certificate management
    #   * Configure the NTP client (chronyd)
    #   * Create and configure an instance of Directory Server
    #   * Create and configure a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
    #   * Configure Apache (httpd)
    #   * Configure the KDC to enable PKINIT
    # 
    # To accept the default shown in brackets, press the Enter key.
    # 
    # Do you want to configure integrated DNS (BIND)? [no]: 
    # 
    # Enter the fully qualified domain name of the computer
    # on which you're setting up server software. Using the form
    # <hostname>.<domainname>
    # Example: master.example.com.
    # 
    # 
    # Server host name [ipa.{{ domain }}]: 
    # 
    # The domain name has been determined based on the host name.
    # 
    # Please confirm the domain name [{{ domain }}]: 
    # 
    # The kerberos protocol requires a Realm name to be defined.
    # This is typically the domain name converted to uppercase.
    # 
    # Please provide a realm name [ONESTEIN.LAN]: 
    # Certain directory server operations require an administrative user.
    # This user is referred to as the Directory Manager and has full access
    # to the Directory for system management tasks and will be added to the
    # instance of directory server created for IPA.
    # The password must be at least 8 characters long.
    # 
    # Directory Manager password: 
    # Password (confirm): 
    # 
    # The IPA server requires an administrative user, named 'admin'.
    # This user is a regular system account used for IPA server administration.
    # 
    # IPA admin password: 
    # Password (confirm): 
    # 
    # Do you want to configure chrony with NTP server or pool address? [no]: 
    # 
    # The IPA Master Server will be configured with:
    # Hostname:       ipa.{{ domain }}
    # IP address(es): 10.11.1.242
    # Domain name:    {{ domain }}
    # Realm name:     ONESTEIN.LAN
    # 
    # The CA will be configured with:
    # Subject DN:   CN=Certificate Authority,O=ONESTEIN.LAN
    # Subject base: O=ONESTEIN.LAN
    # Chaining:     self-signed
    # 
    # Continue to configure the system with these values? [no]: yes
